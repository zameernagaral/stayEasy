# StayEasy 🏡

**StayEasy** is an Airbnb-inspired room listing platform built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**.
It focuses on clean architecture, server-side rendering, authentication, and real-world backend practices.

This project was built to understand how full-stack web applications work end-to-end — from user authentication to image uploads and access control.

MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
SECRET=your_strong_session_secret
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```
